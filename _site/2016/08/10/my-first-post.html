<h1>My First Post</h1>
<p>August 10, 2016</p>
<p>And awayyyyyy we go on our first adventure with BLOGGING!</p>

<p>It really is a trying task trying to write about yourself. Are you saying too much? Are you saying too little?
Who the hell knows really.</p>

<p>One of my main passions is music. I have played piano since I was about 7 years old and, besides a brief amount of 
  time in my teens, I have grown to appreciate this skill more and more. Whenever I get any amount of free time or 
  really just need a respite to unwind, I will sit down at the keys and play until my heart's content. Depending on
  my mood, I will play something composed or just think of a few chords that sound fun together and just let er rip.
  Sheet music is not cheap either so searching the net for someone that has tabbed out the entire song is very useful.
  One of the main sites that I use is called <a href="www.tabnabber.com">Tabnabber</a>. It is a great and easy way to 
  look up a song that may have popped into your head and then second later, you can be playing it yourself!</p>
  
  <p>The piano is one of the most elegant instruments I believe and really is a great tool to learn music in general</p>

<p>My other passion is sports. Basketball to be more specific. Although I do love competition in general. I grew up playing
basketball and it really was one of the first things to give me great confidence as a kid. I loved the immediate results of
success seeing the ball go through the basket. I played through high school and here and there in college before I ended up
getting a job with the Denver Nuggets as a video coordinator in 2005. This was absolutely a dream job for me as I got to mingle
with my heroes on a daily basis. And besides that, I was able to see the inner workings of how these professional teams 
functioned from the inside out. What I did not realize was how much time was spent traveling. Which I loved at first but 
eventually became very tiring. Along with the lack of job security, I decided to transition to a different career. Which brings 
me to the present day of learning to become a programmer!</p>
